instanceof:
The instanceof operator in Java is used to check whether an object is an instance of a specific class or a subclass (or implements an interface). 

class Base {}
class Derived extends Base {}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Base b1 = new Derived(); // polymorphic reference

        if (b1 instanceof Derived) {
            System.out.println("b1 is a Derived object.");
        }

        if (b1 instanceof Base) {
            System.out.println("b1 is a Base object."); // This will run too
        }
    }
}

Summary:
b1 instanceof Base returns true if b1 is an object of class Base or any subclass of Base.

It's used to safely check types before casting or to drive logic based on object type.
